# CLI

My little CLI to make things easier to use.
Done in a language that I want to learn
TODO

It should
- Get ready for install
- Ask and prompt about what the what type the system is (desktop/server)
- Ask and prompt about whether the machine will be remotely managed (default: true)
- Get networking up and running quickly
- Install and setup machine as quickly and painlessly as possible. (w/SSH if remotely managed)
- Print hardware file for easy copy and paste
- Prompt for a reboot
- If desktop, make sure the repo is cloned (READ-ONLY if remotely managed - MAY change in the future)
- Handle self upgrades or other nice stuff
