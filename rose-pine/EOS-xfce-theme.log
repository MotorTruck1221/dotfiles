If you agree to change Xfce theme to EndeavourOS default, your previous theme
will be saved into folder $HOME/.config/xfce4.20220704-01:26:32

To restore the previous theme:
     - remove folder $HOME/.config/xfce4
     - rename $HOME/.config/xfce4.20220704-01:26:32 into $HOME/.config/xfce4

(Note: this info is stored into file $HOME/.config/EOS-xfce-theme.log).

Reboot is required for the theme change to take effect.

Accept theme change and reboot now?
